Being a person from BPO industry for 14+ years i have seen lot of behaviour things in employees within teams and some of the examples where people actually start looking for another job and as soon as they apply and get offer , even of they dont want to leave company , they still go with the flow due to various factors , example their tenure, less chances for promotion , IJP , their manager's diplomatic behaviour etc.
The intresting model was HR attrition where i had a good amount of input factors to predict the attrition (Yes/No) which i enjoyed most in EDA before concluding the model.
Of course Gender , Education , Department are not significantly involved in attrition however things like Job Level , Age , Job satisfaction , Working years , Years in current role , Years with current managerare really and practically important to impact someone's thinking of looking for another option.
Hence i wanted all of those factors to be in while creating a model. As the data had many outliers so of course in EDA i had to remove them using Zscore method and then using SMOTE technique i had made a balance before training the model.Testing it using various models i found the Hypertuning technique using Grid Search CV provided the best result of 94% accuarcy score with 92% cross validation score.
